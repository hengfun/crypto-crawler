## Chrome Driver Setup

This project uses Selenium with Chrome for web scraping. Here's how to set it up:

### Option 1: Using undetected-chromedriver (Recommended)

This project uses `undetected-chromedriver` which helps bypass detection mechanisms. The package is already included in requirements.txt.

1. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed on your system
2. The driver will be automatically downloaded and configured when you run the scraper

### Option 2: Manual Chrome Driver Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

1. Check your Chrome version:
   - Open Chrome
   - Go to â‹® (three dots) > Help > About Google Chrome
   - Note your Chrome version number

2. Download the matching ChromeDriver:
   - Visit [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)
   - Download the version matching your Chrome browser
   - Extract the executable

3. Add ChromeDriver to your PATH:
   - **Windows**: 
     - Copy chromedriver.exe to `C:\Windows\System32` or
     - Add the chromedriver location to your System Environment Variables
   - **Linux/MacOS**:
     ```bash
     sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
     ```

## Additional Setup
